# Study Buddy
The tool recommends degrees from different universities across Germany to students in pursuit of a bachelor’s or master’s degree. It takes your interest in account along with your preference of language of instruction, degree type, and rating score. All you need to do is type in a word or two and the tool recommends programs that best matches what you like. You can view details of the programs, including a description. Additionally, you can get more insights about the recommendation through interactive visuals.
